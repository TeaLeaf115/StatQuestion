This project was from game we played in my Statistics class.

We had to simulate rolling 2 dice and multiplying the sum of the number, then if the sum was odd we marked it down, we then repeated it 20 times.

We were simulating dice rolls on our TI-84 calculators and he taught us how to seed our calculator.

I came up with the idea to find seeds in java on what seed(s) would work for java.util.Random to generate essentially 0 odd numbers in a row.

So this was born!

If you want to spend days cracking seeds where I left off there whould be a few billion to find ;)

Just make a pull request and start cracking!
